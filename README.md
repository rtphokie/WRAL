My 4th grade teacher told me to show my work, and she was right. This repository shows the work put into some of 
the facts, figures and findings in the [WRAL Weather Blog](https://www.wral.com/weather/blog/1028424/), most often around astronomy topics. In support of these articles:

* Daylight Savings Time - to be published
* [Transit of Mercury](https://www.wral.com/see-the-rare-transit-of-mercury-on-monday/18753468/)
